━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
**STEP 2: DETERMINE SCENE TYPE FROM THEME GUIDELINES**

**Define contextual props:**
*   A high-quality, coffee-colored ceramic cappuccino cup and saucer, placed to the left of the machine.

*   **Environmental storytelling:** The setting is pristine and organized, ready for morning service. The presence of the milk pitcher, high-quality cup, and artisanal beans reinforces the machine's function and suggests a focus on quality coffee, all while the machine is in a clean, resting state.
*   **Depth:** A shallow depth of field, keeping the espresso machine and immediate props sharp while the background elements are softly and pleasingly blurred.
