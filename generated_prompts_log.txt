[X] Option B - Standalone

**Contextual Props:**
*   A wooden cutting board with a few sprigs of fresh rosemary and a chef's knife resting beside an uncut lemon.
*   A minimalist white ceramic bottle of hand soap.
*   A neatly folded, neutral-colored linen dish towel hanging over the edge of the sink basin.
