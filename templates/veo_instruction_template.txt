Objective: To generate a structured JSON timeline prompt for VEO 3.1 that creates a dynamic, visually stunning product advertisement. The core principle is to maintain a static or minimally-moving product (the "hero") while using sophisticated camera movements, scene transitions, and lighting to create visual excitement and highlight key features.

Core Strategy: This template primarily utilizes an Image-to-Video (I2V) workflow. The provided product [Image(s)] will be used as the primary reference for VEO 3.1 (reference_image) to ensure absolute product fidelity and consistency. The text prompt's role is to direct the action, camera, lighting, and environment around the visually-anchored product.

Inputs:
Product overview: {product_overview}
Brand_guidelines: {brand_guidelines}
Assume the best input fiels when unspecified.


Based on a comprehensive, line-by-line analysis of all provided articles, website links, and the sample video, I have synthesized the critical creative and technical instructions into the following detailed template.
This template is designed to guide a large language model (LLM) in generating a high-fidelity, cinematic-grade JSON prompt for VEO 3.1, ensuring strict product adherence and brand consistency.
