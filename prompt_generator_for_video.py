---------------------------------------------------------
You are generating a Veo 3.1 prompt in JSON form for a fast-paced roundtable (turntable-style) product commercial. Output only a JSON array with exactly {{num_segments}} objects (one per 8-second segment). No extra text.

Inputs:
Product overview: {product_overview}
Brand_guidelines: {brand_guidelines}
Assume the best inpput fiels when unspecified.
- {{product_overview}}: official name; exact color(s); materials; textures/finishes; dimensions; printed/engraved marks; logo/wordmark placement; defining geometry; packaging if shown; environment constraints.
- {{brand_guidelines}}: palette; typography; logo usage; motion/animation principles; tone; forbidden treatments.
- {{total_duration}}: multiple of 8 seconds.
- {{aspect_ratio}}: e.g., 16:9, 9:16, 1:1.
- {{resolution}}: e.g., 4K.
- {{fps}}: e.g., 24 or 30.
- {{music_style}}: e.g., cinematic pulse, minimalist piano, percussive tech, and so on...
- {{audio_sfx}}: e.g., airy risers, whoosh, tactile clicks, subtle chimes, and so on...
- {{set_environment}}: round table/plinth material/finish/color; background (e.g., seamless black cove, white infinity, gradient); any minimal props (brand-approved only).
- {{lighting_mood}}: e.g., high-contrast rim + crisp speculars; soft wrap; neon edge accents; volumetric slits; and so on...
- {{camera_language_preferences}}: e.g., dolly-in, orbit (degrees + direction), tracking skim, crane drop, rack focus, whip-pan, low-angle hero, dutch (subtle), and so on...
- {{feature_priority}}: list of features to reveal; each converted to 2‚Äì3 words only.
- {{typography}}: brand font or exact fallback.
- {{palette_for_text}}: brand-approved colors with contrast guidance.
- {{plinth_rotation_allowed}}: true/false. If true, slow constant rotation only (not implying product operation).

Rules (apply to every frame, in every segment):
- ABSOLUTE PRODUCT FIDELITY: never alter/invent/misrepresent any feature, color, material, texture, finish, logo placement/kerning, or dimensions. No exploded/internal views. No variant colorways.
- NO HUMAN INTERACTION: no hands/faces/operators.
- NOT IN OPERATION: the product must remain stationary (only camera and/or plinth may move).
- TEXT OVERLAYS: exactly 2‚Äì3 words, rendered by Veo in-frame (no post). Use {{typography}} with {{palette_for_text}}. Place in safe areas without occluding critical details.
- CONTINUITY: identical product instance across all segments (same geometry, markings, finishes, colors).
- COLOR ACCURACY: lighting must not shift true product color. Control reflections/refractions physically plausibly.
- CLEANLINESS: no dust/fingerprints/smudges unless brand-authorized.

Camera/lighting guidance:
Favor slow tactile surface glides (dolly-in/orbit) to reveal the brand/logo under dramatic lighting, followed by fast transitions (whip-pan or on-beat cut) into the next feature. Maintain level horizon unless a subtle dutch is requested. Chain moves when needed. Use 35‚Äì50mm for hero, 85‚Äì105mm for macro textures. Use the {{camera_language_preferences}} list and the option catalogs (and so on...).

Output format:
Output only a JSON array with exactly {{num_segments}} segment objects.
Mini timestamps in a 8 second window is also allowed but each should follow the schema
Each object must use this schema:

----------------------------------------
Prompt structure hierarchy: Subject ‚Üí Context ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Style ‚Üí Ambiance to reduce ambiguity and drift.
Cinematic language control: Dolly, pan, tracking, crane/aerial, POV, wide/close/low-angle, Dutch, rack focus. We adapt these to product showcases (surface reveals, brand mark reveals, feature macro shots).
Camera chaining: ‚ÄúDolly-in, then rack focus‚Äù + lens/light cues: ‚Äúgolden-hour glow, 35 mm anamorphic.‚Äù
8-second caps: We split total duration into 8-second segments and plan one cohesive scene per segment to maintain continuity.
Text overlays: 2‚Äì3 words only, time-coded, rendered by Veo in-frame (no post).
Cinematic fragments adapted to marketing products (swap/chain/mix as needed)

Dolly-in: ‚Äú‚Ä¶gentle dolly-in along the brushed aluminum bevel; logo emerges in crisp specular highlights‚Ä¶‚Äù
Pan: ‚Äú‚Ä¶measured pan right to trace the contour seam; silhouette pops against a gradient backdrop‚Ä¶‚Äù
Tracking: ‚Äú‚Ä¶dynamic tracking shot skimming the product‚Äôs surface micro-texture; reflections glide‚Ä¶‚Äù
Crane/Aerial: ‚Äú‚Ä¶overhead crane drop to a centered hero on a round table; descending reveal of the brand mark‚Ä¶‚Äù
POV: ‚Äú‚Ä¶macro POV as if the lens is grazing the glass edge; refractions remain accurate to material‚Ä¶‚Äù
Wide: ‚Äú‚Ä¶wide hero of the product within a minimalist infinity cove; scale and symmetry established‚Ä¶‚Äù
Close/Extreme close: ‚Äú‚Ä¶extreme close-up of the knurled dial; clean engraved type remains pin-sharp‚Ä¶‚Äù
Low-angle: ‚Äú‚Ä¶low-angle hero framing to feel iconic and monolithic; no distortion of dimensions‚Ä¶‚Äù
Dutch: ‚Äú‚Ä¶subtle dutch-angle to inject tension before a whip-pan transition to the logo reveal‚Ä¶‚Äù
Rack focus: ‚Äú‚Ä¶rack focus from the brushed edge in foreground to the embossed brand crest in background‚Ä¶‚Äù
How to direct the model (for Gemini ‚Üí Veo)

Swap nouns/adjectives to match your product scene (e.g., ‚Äúartisan‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúengineer,‚Äù ‚Äútapestry‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúcircuit board‚Äù).
Chain moves for richer plans: ‚Äúslow dolly-in, then rack focus, then whip-pan transition.‚Äù
Mix with lighting/lens cues for specificity: ‚Äúhard key with razor speculars, 100mm macro, shallow DOF.‚Äù
Absolute constraints for product commercials

Absolute Product Fidelity (primary directive): Never alter, invent, or misrepresent any feature, color, material, texture, finish, logo, or dimension. No exploded views, no internals, no variant colorways or prototypes. Preserve geometry, scale, and printed/engraved elements in every frame.
No Human Interaction: No hands, models, operators, or usage demos. The product is an autonomous, pristine artifact.
Not in Operation: Do not depict the product operating, emitting, folding, disassembling, or changing state.
Text Overlays: Must be rendered by Veo, 2‚Äì3 words max, in the brand‚Äôs style. Time-coded per segment. No post.
Continuity: The same exact product instance must persist across all segments with locked features/colors/materials.
Meta-prompting framework for Gemini 2.5 Pro
Goal: Get Gemini to output one precise Veo prompt with time-coded segments, camera/lighting/lens controls, overlay schedule, brand fidelity locks, and cinematic continuity.

Inputs Gemini should request or parse

{{product_overview}}: official name, exact color(s), materials, textures, finishes, dimensions, logos/marks, surface features, unique design elements, packaging if shown, environment constraints.
{{brand_guidelines}}: color palette, typography, logo usage, tone, motion/animation principles, do/don‚Äôts.
{{total_duration}}: must be a multiple of 8 seconds. Segments = {total_duration}/8.
{{aspect_ratio}}: 16:9, 9:16, 1:1, etc.

Gemini‚Äôs output schema to Veo (one single prompt)

Global header: product identity locks + brand fidelity constraints.
Global visual/audio style.
Segment plan: per 8-second segment, specify a single cohesive scene with camera/lens/lighting/motion, plus the specific overlay text and exact timecode within that segment.
Transitions between segments.
Strict negations: no humans, no operation, no altering features, no changing colors/materials.
Continuity locks: exact product maintained across all segments/angles.
Self-check Gemini must run before finalizing

Does every visual claim exist in {product_overview}? If not, remove or ask for clarification.
Are all overlays 2‚Äì3 words, brand-safe, and non-obscuring?
Is the total duration a multiple of 8, and segments equal {total_duration}/8?
Are camera/lens/light instructions unambiguous and physically plausible?
Are there any depictions of operation or interaction? Remove if yes.
Is product geometry/color/logo identical across segments?
Template A ‚Äî Roundtable (Turntable-Style) Product Commercial
Use this when you want a premium 360-style hero on a round table/turntable with dynamic camera and fast transitions.

You are crafting a single Veo 3/3.1 prompt to generate a fast-paced, premium roundtable product commercial. Follow all constraints below. Output only the final Veo prompt.

Inputs:

{{product_overview}} = [Paste verbatim official product details: name, exact color(s), materials, textures/finishes, dimensions, printed/engraved marks, logos/wordmarks, unique features, packaging if shown, any environmental constraints.]
{{brand_guidelines}} = [Paste: palette, typography, logo usage, motion/animation principles, tone, forbidden treatments.]
{{total_duration}} = [e.g., 16, 24, 32 seconds; must be multiple of 8]
{{aspect_ratio}} = [16:9, 9:16, 1:1, etc.]
{{resolution}} = [e.g., 4K]
{{fps}} = [e.g., 24 or 30]
{{music_style}} = [e.g., modern electronic pulses, minimalist piano, ambient cinematic, percussive tech, and so on...]
{{set_environment}} = [e.g., matte black round table in seamless black cove; glass round plinth on white infinity cyclorama; brushed steel disc on gradient backdrop; and so on...]
{{lighting_mood}} = [e.g., high-contrast rim light with crisp speculars; golden-hour warm key with cool fill; neon edge lights; volumetric slits; and so on...]
{{camera_language_preferences}} = [Pick multiple and allow chaining: dolly-in, orbit, tracking skim, overhead crane drop, whip-pan, rack focus, macro pass, dutch angle, low-angle hero, tilt-up reveal, and so on...]
{{feature_priority}} = [3‚Äì6 short benefit labels, each 2‚Äì3 words max. Example: ‚ÄúAerospace Alloy,‚Äù ‚ÄúTrue Color,‚Äù ‚ÄúUltra Slim,‚Äù and so on...]
{{typography}} = [brand font specifics; fallback sans if unknown]
{{palette_for_text}} = [brand color guidance and contrast]
{{audio_sfx}} = [optional: subtle chimes, airy risers, tactile clicks, deep whoosh, and so on...]
Non-negotiable directives (apply to every frame):

ABSOLUTE PRODUCT FIDELITY: Use the exact product in {{product_overview}}. Do not alter, invent, or misrepresent any feature, color, material, texture, finish, printed/engraved detail, or dimension. No exploded views, no internals, no variant colorways. Maintain identical geometry and logo placement across all segments.
NO HUMAN INTERACTION: No hands, faces, operators, or usage demonstrations.
NOT IN OPERATION: Do not depict the product operating, emitting, changing state, or being handled.
LOGO/TYPE LOCK: Render brand marks exactly as specified (size, placement, kerning/engraving fidelity).
MATERIAL PHYSICS: Preserve physically correct reflections/refractions for glass/metal/coatings; no smearing or warping.
BACKGROUND CONSISTENCY: Keep set and props consistent across segments unless explicitly updated for a planned transition.
CLEANLINESS: No dust, fingerprints, smudges, or scratches unless explicitly stated in {brand_guidelines}.
Global style:

Aspect ratio: {{aspect_ratio}}; Resolution: {{resolution}}; Frame rate: {{fps}}; Photorealistic, premium commercial look. Shallow DOF for macro shots; crisp, controlled specular highlights; subtle bloom only if brand-appropriate.
Set: {{set_environment}}. Round table/plinth is central; product remains fixed precisely at center; if the table rotates, rotation speed is slow and constant for elegance, never implying operation.
Lighting: {{lighting_mood}}. Use controlled rim and key lights to sculpt form and showcase real materials. Avoid color casts that misrepresent true product color.
Lens/Grade: Mix of 35mm‚Äì85mm for hero shots; 90‚Äì105mm macro for texture. Anamorphic bokeh only if brand-appropriate. Color grade honors {brand_guidelines} palette and true-to-life product colors.
Music: {{music_style}}. Add tasteful SFX: {{audio_sfx}}. No voiceover.
Text overlay policy:

Veo must render text in-frame. No post-production. Use {{typography}} with {{palette_for_text}}, high legibility, positioned in safe areas that do not occlude critical product features. Each overlay must be 2‚Äì3 words max.
Cinematic language (examples to use and chain):

Orbit around the product on the round table; gentle dolly-in along surface lines; tracking skim over edges; overhead crane drop to hero; rack focus logo reveal; whip-pan between details; low-angle iconic hero; tilt-up brand crest reveal; dutch used sparingly for tension; macro pass on textures; and so on...
Plan by 8-second segments:

Total duration = {total_duration} seconds. Segments = {total_duration}/8. Each segment is one cohesive scene with dynamic camera and a single clear visual idea. Do NOT split into 2-second micro-beats. Ensure continuity of product instance.
Segment blueprint structure (repeat for each segment):

Segment {{i}}:
Scene purpose: [state the single cinematic goal for this segment]
Camera + lens: [e.g., 45¬∞ orbit clockwise, slow dolly-in, 85mm hero; or 100mm macro glide along edge; chain moves as needed]
Motion speed: [slow/medium/fast; specify acceleration if any]
Lighting: [key/fill/rim; specular behavior; any motivated light sweeps]
Background/set: [confirm same round table/plinth and set continuity]
Composition: [framing, negative space, logo positioning; avoid warping]
Transition out: [e.g., whip-pan right; match cut on logo; hard cut on beat]
Overlay text: [2‚Äì3 words from {{feature_priority}}], on-screen at [mm:ss to mm:ss within this 8s], [position], [entry/exit style: subtle fade/slide], adhere to {{typography}}/{{palette_for_text}}
Transitions between segments:

Specify exact transition type and direction (e.g., whip-pan right ‚Üí left match; on-beat hard cut; parallax crossfade), synchronized to music beats to preserve energy.
Hard negatives:
NOTE: The product should not be depicted in operating state. It is stationary and only the camera moves around it in a captivating way, placed in a roundtable appropriate for the product.
No hands, no operation, no variant colors, no environment reflections with people, no inaccurate refractions, no exploding/tearing the product, no text beyond overlays defined here.
Deliver the final Veo prompt as a valid JSON array with exactly {num_segments} objects, one per 8-second segment.
Do NOT write as a single narrative prompt. Do NOT include explanatory text outside the JSON. Be precise and elaborate about every frames.
