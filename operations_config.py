OPERATION: Macro Close-Up for E-Commerce Product Detail

GOAL: Create a zoomed-in view showing product texture, material quality, and craftsmanship details that help customers make informed purchasing decisions.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: The zoomed texture must be EXACTLY as it appears in the original image. Do not generate, enhance, or fabricate texture details. Only magnify what actually exists in the source image.

E-COMMERCE CONTEXT:
This close-up will be part of a product listing image set. Customers use detail shots to:
- Verify material quality (stitching, weave, finish, surface treatment)
- Check craftsmanship (precision, build quality, component details)
- Assess authenticity and product condition
- Make confident purchase decisions

INTELLIGENT AREA SELECTION (when user doesn't specify):
Analyze the product image and select the most valuable detail area for e-commerce based on:

Priority 1 - Quality Indicators:
- Stitching quality (for apparel, furniture, bags)
- Material texture (fabric weave, metal finish, wood grain, plastic texture)
- Manufacturing precision (seams, joints, edges, machining marks)
- Brand logos or badges (close-up of embossed/printed branding)

Priority 2 - Unique Features:
- Patented mechanisms or innovative design elements
- Premium materials (leather grain, carbon fiber weave, brushed aluminum)
- Functional details (buttons, zippers, connectors, fasteners)
- Quality certifications or rating labels

Priority 3 - Differentiation Points:
- Elements that distinguish this product from competitors
- High-value components that justify pricing
- Warranty tags or authenticity marks

AVOID These Areas (poor e-commerce value):
- Plain surfaces with no distinctive features
- Generic plastic or smooth metal with no texture
- Areas with glare, shadows, or poor original image quality
- Background or non-product elements

EXAMPLE APPROACHES:

Example 1 - Apparel Product (Jacket):
"Identify the area with the most visible stitching quality - likely a seam, collar, or pocket edge. Zoom to 400% magnification on this stitching detail. Frame the shot to show 3-4 inches of the seam, filling 75% of the image. The stitching thread, fabric weave, and seam precision must appear EXACTLY as in the original photo - same thread color, same stitch spacing, same fabric texture. Use shallow depth of field with the stitching in razor-sharp focus. Apply soft blur (8px) to background fabric for depth. Lighting should enhance visibility without altering the actual appearance."

Example 2 - Electronics (Laptop):
"Locate the most informative port or interface area - typically the side panel with USB-C, HDMI, or charging ports. Zoom to 350% magnification centering on these ports. Fill 80% of frame with the port cluster. Show the exact metal finish, port labeling, and precision of the cutouts as they appear in the original image. No enhancement of details - only magnification. Use clean, even lighting to show port depth and metal finish clearly. Sharp focus on port openings, slight blur (10px) on surrounding chassis."

Example 3 - Furniture (Chair):
"Find the upholstery texture or wood joint that best demonstrates quality. For fabric: zoom 300% on the weave showing fabric density and texture pattern. For wood: zoom on a visible joint or wood grain detail. Frame to show 6x6 inch area of material, filling 70% of frame. Texture must match original image perfectly - same weave pattern, same wood grain, same color and finish. Use angled lighting (45 degrees) to reveal texture depth without creating harsh shadows. Primary detail in sharp focus, edges with gradual 12px blur."

Example 4 - Tools/Industrial (Power Drill):
"Identify the area showing build quality - typically the motor housing seam, grip texture, or brand badge. Zoom 350% on the selected detail. If grip: show the rubber texture pattern exactly as it appears in original. If seam: show how precisely parts fit together. If badge: show embossing depth and text clarity. Fill 75% of frame with the detail. Maintain absolute color accuracy and texture fidelity to original image. Use directional lighting to emphasize three-dimensional aspects of the detail."

Example 5 - Beauty/Cosmetics (Bottle):
"Focus on label details, cap threading, or bottle material finish. Zoom 300% on the most informative area. If label: show text clarity and print quality exactly as original. If cap: show threading precision and material finish. If bottle: show glass/plastic clarity and any embossing. Frame detail to fill 80% of image. Colors, text, and textures must be identical to source image. Lighting should show material quality (reflectivity, transparency, surface finish) clearly."

USER SPECIFICATIONS:
{user_details}

IF NO USER DETAILS PROVIDED:
- Use the intelligent area selection priorities above
- Default to 300-400% magnification
- Fill 70-80% of frame with the selected detail
- Ensure the detail has genuine e-commerce value
- Maintain absolute fidelity to original image texture

TECHNICAL EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS:

Magnification & Framing:
- Zoom level: 300-500% depending on detail size
- Frame composition: Detail fills 70-85% of image
- Leave 15-30% as context (slightly blurred surrounding area)

Focus & Depth:
- Primary detail: Razor-sharp focus (0% blur)
- Immediate surrounding: Slight blur (5-8px) for depth
- Background context: Moderate blur (12-20px) to maintain focus on detail

Lighting for Detail Visibility:
- Use directional lighting (30-60 degree angle) to reveal texture depth
- Avoid flat lighting that hides surface details
- Avoid harsh lighting that creates confusing shadows
- Goal: Make texture and quality clearly visible to customers

Color & Texture Accuracy:
- CRITICAL: Texture appearance must match original image exactly
- No AI enhancement or fabrication of details
- No color shifts or saturation changes
- No sharpening artifacts or noise reduction that alters texture
- What's in the original is what's shown - just larger

Professional E-Commerce Standards:
- Image should look professionally photographed
- Detail should be immediately understandable to customers
- Should answer the question: "What is this product made of?"
- Should build confidence in product quality
- No distracting elements or confusing compositions
NOTE: The examples are for reference and you are not restricted to be imaginative(but professional)

OPERATION: Intelligent Exploded Assembly View Generation

GOAL: Create a logical, educational exploded view showing how the product is assembled, what components it contains, and how parts fit together.

CRITICAL THINKING REQUIREMENTS:
Before creating the exploded view, analyze the product image and reason through:

1. PRODUCT STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:
   - What is this product's primary function?
   - What internal components would be needed for this function?
   - What is the logical assembly sequence (outside-in or inside-out)?
   - What fasteners or connection methods are likely used?

2. VISIBLE COMPONENT IDENTIFICATION:
   - External casing/housing (usually the largest part to preserve)
   - Visible access panels, covers, or removable parts
   - Control interfaces (buttons, knobs, displays)
   - Connectors, ports, or attachment points
   - Mounting hardware visible in the image

3. LOGICAL INTERNAL COMPONENTS (must reason based on product type):
   - Power source (battery, motor, engine, electrical components)
   - Functional mechanism (gears, pumps, heating elements, cutting blades)
   - Structural frame or chassis
   - Fasteners (screws, bolts, clips, snap-fits)
   - Seals, gaskets, or protective elements

4. ASSEMBLY LOGIC:
   - How would a technician assemble this product?
   - Which parts go together first?
   - What is the logical separation sequence for maximum clarity?

CRITICAL PRESERVATION REQUIREMENT:
The OUTER SHELL/CASING must remain complete and recognizable. Do not fragment, alter, or distort the main housing. Show it as one cohesive piece with other components separated from it.

EXPLODED VIEW PRINCIPLES:

Separation Strategy:
- Separate components along natural assembly axes (vertical, horizontal, or radial)
- Maintain logical spatial relationships (parts stay aligned with their mounting positions)
- Create clear visual gaps (2-6 inches between major components)
- Preserve component orientation (parts should look ready to slide back into place)

Alignment & Positioning:
- Use a consistent explosion axis (typically straight up, or along product's main axis)
- Keep components aligned on their assembly path
- Spacing should be proportional to component size
- Larger components: 4-6 inch separation
- Smaller components: 2-3 inch separation
- Hardware (screws, bolts): 1-2 inch separation, grouped logically

Visual Hierarchy:
- Main housing: Most prominent, usually bottom or center
- Primary mechanism: Separated but clearly related to housing
- Secondary components: Logically positioned around primary
- Hardware/fasteners: Grouped and positioned near their mounting points

LABELING & ANNOTATION SYSTEM:

Connection Lines:
- From each separated component: Draw a thin, clean line (1-2px) to its text label
- Line should originate from the component's center or most recognizable feature
- Line travels to the label WITHOUT crossing the product or other components
- Line style: Solid or dashed, in contrasting color (dark gray on light bg, white on dark bg)
- Line ends: Small circle or dot at component, arrow or plain end at label

Label Positioning:
- Arrange labels in organized columns on LEFT or RIGHT side of the exploded view
- Leave minimum 2 inches clearance from all product components
- Align labels vertically with consistent spacing (0.5-1 inch between labels)
- Connect each label to its component with the connection line

Label Content:
- Component name (e.g., "Housing Cover", "Motor Assembly", "Battery Pack")
- Optional: Part number or brief description in smaller text below
- Font: Arial or Helvetica, Bold for component name, Regular for description
- Size: 12-14pt for name, 9-10pt for description
- Color: High contrast with background

Numbering System (optional but professional):
- Number each component (1, 2, 3...) in assembly sequence
- Place number in a small circle on or near each component
- Match numbers in the label list
- Format: "1. Main Housing", "2. Motor Mount", etc.

EXAMPLE APPROACHES:

Example 1 - Power Tool (Drill):
"Analyze: This is a cordless drill. Core components likely include: outer housing (handle + body), electric motor, gear transmission, battery pack, trigger mechanism, chuck assembly.

OPERATION: Physically-Accurate Material & Surface Finish Transformation

GOAL: Transform the product's surface material or finish while maintaining complete physical realism - accounting for how the new material interacts with lighting, reflections, and the environment.

CRITICAL PHYSICS PRINCIPLE:
Materials interact with light differently. When you change material, you MUST change how light behaves:
- Glossy surfaces create specular highlights and reflections
- Matte surfaces diffuse light evenly with minimal reflections
- Metallic surfaces reflect environment and have colored reflections
- Transparent/translucent materials transmit and refract light
- Textured surfaces create micro-shadows and light scattering

This is NOT just a color change - it's a complete physics simulation of material properties.

MATERIAL PHYSICS UNDERSTANDING:

REFLECTIVITY (How light bounces):
- Mirror finish (chrome, polished metal): 80-95% specular reflection, sharp reflections
- High gloss (lacquer, polished plastic): 60-80% specularity, clear but softer reflections
- Semi-gloss (satin finish): 30-50% specularity, diffused reflections
- Matte (rubber, unfinished wood): 5-15% specularity, mostly diffuse reflection
- Flat (chalk, fabric): 0-5% specularity, pure diffuse reflection

LIGHT INTERACTION CHANGES:
When material changes from matte plastic → glossy metal:
- Highlights become sharper and brighter (increase intensity 50-80%)
- New reflections appear showing environment/surroundings
- Shadow edges may sharpen (less light scatter)
- Color may shift (metals have colored reflections: gold=warm, steel=cool, copper=orange-tint)

When material changes from glossy → matte:
- Existing sharp highlights soften and spread (decrease intensity 40-60%)
- Specular reflections disappear or blur significantly
- Surface appears more uniform in tone
- Shadows may soften slightly (more light scatter)

When material changes from smooth → textured:
- Micro-shadows appear in texture valleys
- Highlights fragment across texture peaks
- Light scatters more (slight overall brightening in shadows)
- Surface appears less uniform, more complex

ENVIRONMENTAL REFLECTION SIMULATION:

Metallic/Glossy Surfaces Need Environment Reflections:
- Chrome/polished metal: Reflect surroundings (if white background, show subtle white/gray reflections)
- Brushed metal: Anisotropic reflections (directional streaks based on grain direction)
- Colored metals: Tint reflections (gold adds warmth, copper adds orange, brass adds yellow)
- Glossy paint: Reflect environment softly, blurred compared to bare metal

Matte Surfaces Have Minimal Reflections:
- Rubber: No environment reflection, uniform appearance
- Fabric: Slight sheen in highlights but no clear reflections
- Unfinished wood: Directional grain pattern but minimal reflection
- Matte paint: Flat appearance, no environmental cues

LIGHTING RESPONSE ADJUSTMENTS:

Analyze Original Lighting:
- Identify light source direction (where are current highlights?)
- Identify shadow positions and hardness
- Note any existing reflections or specular highlights

Adapt for New Material:
- Glossy materials: Increase highlight intensity, make smaller and sharper
- Matte materials: Decrease highlights, spread them out, soften edges
- Metallic materials: Add environmental reflections aligned with light direction
- Textured materials: Add micro-detail in lighting (small highlights on texture peaks)

EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATIONS:

Example 1 - Plastic to Brushed Aluminum:
"Current material: Matte black plastic with minimal reflections and soft highlights.

Target material: Brushed aluminum (horizontal grain).

Physical changes required:
- Base color: Change to metallic gray (RGB: 180, 185, 188) with slight cool blue undertone
- Grain texture: Add horizontal directional lines (0.2mm spacing) across ALL surfaces
- Reflectivity: Increase from 10% to 65% specularity
- Highlights: Original soft highlights → Sharp, elongated horizontal streaks (anisotropic reflection following grain direction)
- New reflections: Add subtle environmental reflections showing ambient lighting, stretched horizontally by grain
- Existing shadows: Maintain positions but slightly sharpen edges (metal scatters less light than plastic)
- Light interaction: Where light hits directly, show bright horizontal streaks; where indirect, show subtle directional sheen

Lighting analysis: Original image has top-left key light creating highlight on upper surface. For aluminum: Create bright horizontal streak across that same upper surface, 70% brighter than original plastic highlight, 3x narrower, perfectly horizontal regardless of surface angle. Add subtle reflection of the background environment (if white bg, show faint white-to-gray gradient reflection on curved surfaces).

Preserve: Exact product shape, all logos/text (but now appear embossed/engraved in metal), all edges and contours, button positions."

Example 2 - Glossy Paint to Soft-Touch Rubber:
"Current material: High-gloss red paint with sharp specular highlights and clear reflections.

Target material: Soft-touch rubberized coating (matte).

Physical changes required:
- Base color: Maintain similar red hue but reduce saturation by 15% (rubber appears less vivid than gloss paint)
- Reflectivity: Decrease from 75% to 8% specularity
- Highlights: Original sharp, bright highlights (90% white intensity) → Broad, subtle highlights (25% intensity, 4x larger area)
- Reflections: Remove all environmental reflections completely (rubber doesn't reflect environment)
- Surface appearance: Add very fine micro-texture (0.1mm grain) suggesting rubberized feel
- Shadows: Slightly soften shadow edges (matte surfaces scatter more light into shadow areas, lift shadow value by 10%)

Lighting analysis: Original has sharp white highlight on top surface from overhead light. For rubber: Spread this highlight into a broad, gentle lightening of the entire top surface, no sharp edges, peak brightness only 25% toward white instead of 90%. The light wrap-around increases - side surfaces receive 15% more light than in glossy version due to subsurface scattering.

Preserve: Product geometry exactly, all surface details, seams, button locations, brand text (now appears pad-printed on rubber rather than glossy)."

Example 3 - Matte Fabric to High-Gloss Lacquer:
"Current material: Matte woven fabric with visible textile texture and no reflections.

Target material: Automotive-grade glossy lacquer (wet look).

Physical changes required:
- Remove fabric weave texture completely → Perfectly smooth surface
- Base color: Maintain color but increase saturation by 25% (gloss enhances color depth)
- Reflectivity: Increase from 5% to 85% specularity
- New highlights: Add sharp, bright specular highlights at every surface that faces the light source, 80-90% white intensity, small and well-defined
- Environmental reflections: Add blurred reflection of surroundings (ceiling, background elements) on curved surfaces, 30-40% opacity
- Depth perception: Gloss creates appearance of depth - add very subtle color gradient (darker in areas facing away from light, 10-15% darker)
- Shadow interaction: Shadows from gloss surfaces are sharper - increase shadow edge definition by 30%

Lighting analysis: Fabric had broad, even illumination with no hotspots. Lacquer version: Add 4-6 distinct specular highlights where surface normal aligns with light source angle. Main highlight on top surface: sharp, 10mm diameter, 85% white. Secondary highlights on curved edges. Add faint reflection of the white background on the glossy surface (white-to-color gradient, 25% opacity).

Preserve: Product form, seams (now appear as panel gaps in lacquer), stitching lines become subtle panel break lines, overall shape exact."

Example 4 - Smooth Plastic to Wood Grain:
"Current material: Smooth injection-molded plastic, slight satin finish.

Target material: Natural oak wood with visible grain and matte polyurethane finish.

Physical changes required:
- Add wood grain pattern: Directional grain lines following product's geometry, 1-3mm spacing, natural variation in width and color (10-15% value variation between grain lines and wood body)
- Base color: Shift to natural oak tone (warm brown, RGB: 160, 120, 80 base with variation)
- Texture: Add fine wood texture with subtle grain ridges (creates micro-shadows in cross-lighting)
- Reflectivity: Adjust to 25% specularity (matte poly finish)
- Highlights: Original highlights → Broader, softer, with slight directional quality following wood grain
- Light scattering: Wood is slightly translucent in thin sections - where edges are thin, add 5-10% warm glow (subsurface scattering simulation)
- Natural variation: Wood has natural color variation - create subtle patches of lighter/darker areas (realistic growth ring patterns)

Lighting analysis: Original plastic had uniform light response. Wood version: Light hitting across grain creates subtle linear highlight streaks following grain direction. Where light hits parallel to grain, highlights are softer and more diffused. Add micro-shadows in grain valleys (2-3% darker than peaks). Edges of product, where wood would be end-grain, show different texture pattern (perpendicular grain lines).

Preserve: Product dimensions exactly, all mounting holes/screw positions (now appear as wood plugs or countersunk), overall industrial design, functional features."

Example 5 - Metal to Carbon Fiber Weave:
"Current material: Brushed stainless steel with directional grain.

Target material: Glossy carbon fiber with visible 2x2 twill weave pattern.

Physical changes required:
- Replace directional metal grain with distinctive carbon fiber 2x2 twill pattern (checkerboard-like weave of fiber bundles, each bundle 3-4mm wide)
- Base color: Deep black with subtle dark gray weave pattern
- Reflectivity: Maintain high specularity (80%) but change reflection character from metallic to glossy resin
- Weave pattern reflections: Each bundle in the weave catches light slightly differently - create alternating highlight pattern where one direction of weave is bright, perpendicular direction is darker
- Depth illusion: Carbon fiber has depth - add very subtle shadow in weave valleys (2-3% darker), highlights on weave peaks
- Reflections: Change from cool metallic reflections to neutral glossy reflections (remove blue tint, add pure environmental reflection)

Lighting analysis: Original metal had horizontal grain highlights. Carbon fiber: Create checkerboard highlight pattern where fiber bundles running perpendicular to light show bright highlights, parallel bundles show darker. Main highlight area shows woven texture clearly with alternating bright/dark bundles (60% bright, 40% less bright in pattern). Curved surfaces show how weave pattern follows product geometry (pattern curves with surface).

Preserve: Product shape exactly, all edges, curves, mounting points, functional elements."

OPERATION: Precision Technical Component Close-Up with Dimensional Accuracy

GOAL: Create a magnified view of technical components (valves, threads, couplings, connectors) that maintains EXACT proportional accuracy from the original image.

CRITICAL ACCURACY REQUIREMENT:
This is a TECHNICAL documentation shot. Proportions, dimensions, and spacing must be PRECISELY maintained from the source image. Users rely on these close-ups to understand exact component specifications, thread pitch, connection types, and fitment details.

DIMENSIONAL PRESERVATION MANDATE:
When zooming on threads, valves, or connections, you must:
- Count and preserve the EXACT number of visible thread grooves in the original image
- Maintain EXACT thread pitch (spacing between grooves) - measure and preserve ratio
- Preserve EXACT length-to-diameter ratios of threaded sections
- Maintain EXACT proportions between connected components (if connector is 1/3 the length of valve body in original, it stays 1/3 in close-up)
- Keep EXACT angular relationships (if fitting is at 90° angle, keep it at 90°)
- Preserve EXACT surface details (number of flats on hex nut, groove count, etc.)

MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS PROCESS:

Before generating the close-up, the LLM must analyze the original image:

1. IDENTIFY the target component clearly
2. COUNT visible details:
   - Number of thread grooves visible
   - Number of turns in a coil/spring
   - Number of flats on hex fittings
   - Number of sealing ridges/o-rings
   - Number of mounting holes/bolts

3. MEASURE proportional relationships:
   - Thread pitch: If 5 grooves span 10mm, each groove is 2mm apart → preserve this 2mm spacing in close-up
   - Length ratios: If threaded section is 1/4 of total component length → keep it 1/4
   - Diameter ratios: If connector diameter is 1/2 of valve body diameter → keep it 1/2
   - Depth ratios: If thread depth is 1/10 of thread diameter → maintain this ratio

4. NOTE surface characteristics:
   - Thread profile (V-thread, square thread, rounded)
   - Surface finish (smooth, knurled, brushed, rough-cast)
   - Material transitions (metal-to-rubber, brass-to-steel)
   - Wear patterns or machining marks

5. VERIFY scale consistency:
   - If original shows 8 threads in a 1-inch section, close-up must show same thread density
   - If gasket thickness is 1/20 of pipe diameter, maintain this ratio
   - If valve handle is 3x the width of the valve stem, keep this proportion

COMPONENT SELECTION PRIORITY:

If user doesn't specify which component to zoom on, analyze the product and select based on:

Priority 1 - Connection Interfaces:
- Threaded connections (most technical detail, shows fitment compatibility)
- Quick-connect fittings (shows mechanism clearly)
- Flanged connections (shows bolt pattern, gasket seating)
- Compression fittings (shows ferrule, nut, and pipe relationship)

Priority 2 - Precision Components:
- Valve seats and sealing surfaces
- Adjustment mechanisms (set screws, calibration points)
- Bearing surfaces or rotating interfaces
- Pressure relief mechanisms

Priority 3 - Quality Indicators:
- Machining quality on critical surfaces
- Thread quality and precision
- Material specifications (alloy markings, ratings)
- Manufacturing tolerances visible at component gaps

EXAMPLE APPROACHES:

Example 1 - Pipe Thread Close-up (NPT Threading):
"Target component: Male threaded end of pipe fitting visible on right side of product image.

DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS of original image:
- Threaded section total length: Approximately 1.5 inches (measure against product for reference)
- Thread count visible: 11 complete thread grooves visible in original image
- Thread pitch calculation: 11 threads in 1.5 inches = 7.3 threads per inch (approximately 3/4" NPT standard)
- Thread depth: Grooves are approximately 1/15th of the outer diameter depth
- Taper: Threads show slight taper (0.75° per side for NPT) - wider at base, narrower at tip
- Transition point: Threads end and smooth pipe begins at a sharp shoulder, located 1.5" from pipe end
- Thread profile: 60-degree V-thread profile with flattened peaks and valleys (NPT standard)

CLOSE-UP COMPOSITION:
Zoom to 400% magnification, centered on the middle section of the threaded area.

Frame composition: 
- Threaded section fills 75% of frame width
- Show 8-9 complete thread grooves in the close-up view (proportionally correct for 400% zoom of 11-groove section)
- Include the thread-to-smooth pipe transition at the edge of frame for context (shows where threads end)

PROPORTIONAL ACCURACY in generated image:
- Thread spacing: 11 grooves in the full threaded section → if showing 60% of threaded section in close-up, display 6-7 grooves with IDENTICAL spacing ratio
- Thread pitch: Maintain 7.3 threads per inch density - grooves should appear evenly spaced at 0.137 inch intervals
- Thread depth: Groove depth remains 1/15th of outer diameter (if pipe shows as 30mm wide in close-up, grooves are 2mm deep)
- Thread profile: Maintain 60° angle, flattened peaks (not sharp V), consistent across all visible threads
- Taper: Show gradual diameter decrease from left to right (base to tip) - 1.5° total taper angle preserved
- Surface finish: Original shows brushed/machined finish - preserve the same directional machining marks running along thread length

LIGHTING for technical clarity:
Use 45-degree side lighting from upper-right to create shadows in thread valleys, making groove depth and profile clearly visible. Shadows in valleys should be 40% darker than peaks, clearly defining thread geometry.

Focus: Razor-sharp focus on threads, slight blur (8px) on background. No focus fall-off across threads - entire threaded section equally sharp.

Result: Technical documentation-quality image where a plumber/technician could verify thread type (NPT), estimate size (3/4"), and confirm compatibility - all proportions accurate to original."

Example 2 - Valve Seat and Washer Detail:
"Target component: Internal valve mechanism visible through partially opened valve assembly.

DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS of original image:
- Valve seat diameter: Approximately 18mm (circular brass seat visible)
- Washer/gasket thickness: 2mm (measured as 1/9th of seat diameter)
- Washer outer diameter: 16mm (slightly smaller than seat, 8/9th ratio)
- Stem diameter passing through: 6mm (1/3 of seat diameter)
- Seat depth: 4mm deep recess (2/9th of diameter)
- Number of sealing ridges on washer: 2 concentric ridges visible

CLOSE-UP COMPOSITION:
Zoom to 500% magnification, centered on valve seat and washer interface.

Frame composition:
- Valve seat fills 60% of frame
- Show complete circular seat and washer
- Include portion of valve stem (above) and valve body (below) for spatial context - 20% of frame each

PROPORTIONAL ACCURACY in generated image:
- Seat diameter to washer diameter: Maintain 18mm:16mm ratio (9:8 ratio)
- Washer thickness: Maintain 2mm (1/9th of seat diameter) - if seat appears as 90mm in close-up, washer is 10mm thick
- Stem to seat ratio: Stem diameter is 1/3 of seat diameter - preserve this exactly
- Seat depth: 4mm recess (2/9th of diameter) - shows clear shadow/depth in close-up
- Sealing ridges: Show EXACTLY 2 concentric ridges on washer (not 1, not 3, exactly 2 as in original)
- Ridge height: Each ridge protrudes 0.5mm (1/4 of total washer thickness) - visible as raised circular lines

Material accuracy:
- Brass seat: Maintain golden brass color, smooth machined surface with circular machining marks
- Rubber washer: Black EPDM rubber, slightly textured surface, soft appearance
- Valve stem: Chrome-plated brass, highly reflective

LIGHTING for material definition:
Top-down lighting to show seat depth clearly. Add slight shadow in seat recess (30% darker than seat surface). Highlight reflection on brass seat (bright ring at edge where light catches machined surface). Rubber washer appears matte with no reflections.

Focus: Sharp focus on washer and seat contact area. Slight blur (5px) on valve stem above and valve body below.

Result: Proportionally accurate view where the exact washer size, thickness, seat diameter, and component relationships are preserved from original - useful for parts identification and replacement."

Example 3 - Coupling and Thread Engagement:
"Target component: Compression coupling connecting two pipe sections, visible in center of product.

DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS of original image:
- Coupling nut length: 25mm (hexagonal nut portion)
- Threaded engagement length: 15mm (how far nut screws onto body)
- Ferrule (compression ring) position: Located 8mm from nut face
- Ferrule thickness: 3mm
- Pipe outer diameter: 12mm
- Thread count on coupling: 18 visible threads on the exterior male threads
- Hex nut: 6 flats, each flat is 8mm wide

CLOSE-UP COMPOSITION:
Zoom to 350% magnification, showing the coupling nut, ferrule, and pipe connection point.

Frame composition:
- Coupling nut (hexagonal portion) fills left 40% of frame
- Ferrule and pipe connection fills center 30%
- Pipe continuation fills right 30%
- Shows complete coupling assembly from nut face to 10mm past ferrule

PROPORTIONAL ACCURACY in generated image:
- Nut length to threaded length ratio: 25mm:15mm (5:3 ratio) - nut is 1.67x the threaded section length - maintain exactly
- Ferrule position: Located 8mm from nut face, which is 8/25 = 32% of nut length from face - preserve this position exactly
- Ferrule thickness to pipe diameter: 3mm:12mm (1:4 ratio) - ferrule is 1/4 of pipe diameter - maintain
- Thread pitch: 18 threads in 15mm = 1.2 threads per mm - if showing full threaded section, display 18 threads with equal spacing
- Thread engagement: Show that 15mm of threads are engaged (portion of threads hidden inside nut) - visible threads end where nut begins
- Hex nut proportions: Each of 6 flats is 8mm wide, nut is 25mm long - maintain 8:25 width-to-length ratio (nearly 1:3)

Assembly detail accuracy:
- Show ferrule compressed slightly against pipe (making conical seal contact)
- Pipe enters nut opening concentrically (pipe centered in nut bore)
- Gap between nut face and ferrule: Exactly 8mm (shows compression adjustment travel)

Material and surface details:
- Hex nut: Nickel-plated brass, 6 distinct flats with slight radius at edges (not sharp corners)
- Ferrule: Brass compression ring with beveled edge facing nut (45° bevel angle)
- Pipe: Copper with slight patina, smooth surface
- Threads: Machine-cut threads with consistent 60° profile

LIGHTING for assembly clarity:
Side lighting at 30° angle from left to create definition between nut flats and to cast shadow in the gap between nut and ferrule. Shadow in gap should be 50% darker, clearly showing the 8mm spacing.

Focus: Sharp focus across entire coupling assembly. Very slight blur (3px) on pipe sections extending beyond coupling area.

Result: Technically accurate view maintaining all dimensional relationships - a technician could verify ferrule position, thread engagement depth, and confirm proper assembly - all proportions match original exactly."

Example 4 - Quick-Connect Fitting Detail:
"Target component: Push-to-connect quick fitting on air line, visible on lower-left of product.

DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS of original image:

- Number of visible o-ring grooves: 2 grooves on fitting body
- O-ring groove spacing: 4mm apart (center to center)
- Tube outer diameter: 8mm (2/5 of fitting body diameter)

CLOSE-UP COMPOSITION:
Zoom to 400% magnification centered on the tube insertion point and release collar.

Frame composition:
- Fitting body fills 50% of frame (center-left)
- Tube extends into right 30% of frame
- Release collar occupies center focus
- Show 12mm of tube insertion plus 15mm of fitting body and 10mm of external tube

PROPORTIONAL ACCURACY in generated image:
- Fitting to tube diameter: 20mm:8mm (5:2 ratio) - fitting is 2.5x tube diameter - maintain exactly
- Release collar to body diameter: 24mm:20mm (6:5 ratio) - collar is 1.2x body - maintain exactly
- Collar width to body diameter: 6mm:20mm (3:10 ratio) - collar is 3/10 of body diameter - preserve
- Tube insertion depth: 12mm visible, which is 3/5 of fitting body diameter (12/20) - maintain this ratio precisely
- O-ring groove spacing: 4mm apart, which is 1/5 of body diameter - if body shows as 100mm in close-up, grooves are 20mm apart
- O-ring count: EXACTLY 2 grooves visible (not 1, not 3), positioned 4mm apart measured center-to-center

Mechanical detail accuracy:
- Show collet teeth inside release collar (8 small teeth visible when looking at collar edge, each tooth approximately 1mm wide)
- O-rings: Seated in grooves, showing slight protrusion (0.5mm above groove surface)
- Tube insertion mark: Visible line where tube surface shows slight compression marking from o-ring contact

Material details:
- Fitting body: Nickel-plated brass, semi-reflective
- Release collar: Blue anodized aluminum, matte finish
- Tube: Clear polyurethane, semi-transparent showing slight internal refraction
- O-rings: Black nitrile rubber, visible in grooves as dark bands

LIGHTING for mechanism visibility:
Front-right lighting at 40° angle to illuminate internal collet teeth when looking into release collar. Add slight internal shadow showing collar depth. O-rings in grooves show shadow on trailing edge (groove depth appears as 1mm shadow).

Focus: Sharp focus on release collar and tube insertion point. Slight blur (6px) on tube extension beyond fitting and fitting body behind collar.

Result: Dimensionally accurate close-up showing exact tube size compatibility, insertion depth, o-ring positions, and fitting proportions - matches original image precisely, useful for verifying fitting size and tube compatibility."

Example 5 - Gear Teeth and Shaft Coupling:
"Target component: Gear teeth and keyway on drive shaft, visible on right side mechanism.

DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS of original image:
- Gear outside diameter: 40mm
- Number of teeth: 24 teeth visible around circumference
- Tooth height: 3mm (from base circle to tip)
- Tooth width at base: 4mm
- Shaft diameter: 16mm (2/5 of gear diameter)
- Keyway width: 4mm (1/4 of shaft diameter)
- Keyway depth: 2mm (1/8 of shaft diameter)
- Tooth spacing (pitch): 360°/24 = 15° between teeth centers

CLOSE-UP COMPOSITION:
Zoom to 450% magnification showing 6-7 gear teeth and portion of shaft with keyway.

Frame composition:
- Gear teeth occupy top 60% of frame showing arc of 6 teeth
- Shaft with keyway occupies bottom 40%
- Transition from gear to shaft clearly visible

PROPORTIONAL ACCURACY in generated image:
- Tooth count in view: Show 6 complete teeth spanning approximately 90° of arc (6 × 15° = 90°)
- Tooth height to gear diameter: 3mm:40mm (3:40 ratio) - teeth are 7.5% of gear diameter - maintain exactly
- Tooth pitch: 15° spacing between tooth centers - if showing 6 teeth, they span exactly 90° of arc, evenly distributed
- Tooth width to height: 4mm:3mm (4:3 ratio) - teeth are slightly wider than tall at base - preserve ratio
- Shaft to gear diameter: 16mm:40mm (2:5 ratio) - shaft is 40% of gear diameter - maintain precisely
- Keyway width to shaft diameter: 4mm:16mm (1:4 ratio) - keyway is 1/4 shaft diameter - preserve exactly
- Keyway depth to shaft diameter: 2mm:16mm (1:8 ratio) - maintain this exact depth proportion

Tooth profile accuracy:
- Involute gear tooth profile: Curved flanks with specific geometry
- Tooth tip: Flat land approximately 1mm wide (1/3 of tooth height)
- Tooth root: Filleted radius approximately 0.5mm (prevents stress concentration)
- Each tooth IDENTICAL in shape and size (precision machining)

Keyway detail accuracy:
- Parallel-sided slot running along shaft length
- Sharp corners at 90° (machined, not rounded)
- Depth creates shadow showing 2mm recess (1/8 of shaft diameter as measured)
- Width exactly 4mm (1/4 of 16mm shaft diameter)

Material and manufacturing marks:
- Gear: Hardened steel, visible heat-treat discoloration (slight blue tint)
- Shaft: Bright steel, machined surface with circumferential tooling marks
- Keyway: Broached finish (parallel marks along keyway length)

LIGHTING for tooth geometry:
Side lighting from upper-left at 50° angle to create shadows on tooth flanks and in keyway. Shadow on trailing flank of each tooth shows tooth depth and involute profile. Shadow in keyway shows 2mm depth clearly (shadow is 60% darker than shaft surface).

Focus: Razor-sharp focus on all 6 visible teeth and keyway. Very slight blur (4px) on shaft and gear extending beyond main focus area.

Result: Precision mechanical view where tooth count, pitch, profile, shaft dimensions, and keyway specifications are all proportionally accurate to original - suitable for engineering verification or parts matching."

EXAMPLE VARIATIONS:

Example 1 - Color Variant:
"Create a variant with the main housing changed to deep blue (Hex: #003366). Maintain exact product geometry, all panel lines, vents, and features. Preserve the glossy finish characteristics - same reflectivity level, same highlight positions. Keep all logos, text, and warning labels in their original colors. Secondary components (buttons, grips, wheels) remain unchanged. The blue should have the same saturation intensity as the original red. All shadows and lighting remain identical."

Example 2 - Finish Variant (Glossy to Matte):
"Transform the finish from glossy to matte while keeping the color (red). Reduce specular highlights to 15% of current intensity. Add subtle micro-texture suggesting matte powder coating. Decrease reflectivity - no environmental reflections. Maintain all product details, shapes, and features exactly. The matte finish should look like professionally applied coating, not dull or chalky. Color saturation may reduce by 10-15% to appear realistic for matte finish."

Example 3 - Pattern Addition:
"Add a carbon fiber texture pattern to the main panels while maintaining the base color. Pattern: fine diagonal weave, 0.5mm grid scale, subtle depth variation. Apply only to flat panel surfaces, keep curved areas solid. Maintain product's glossy finish - the carbon fiber should have realistic clear-coat appearance. All other parts (metal components, rubber grips) remain unchanged. Professional automotive-grade carbon fiber aesthetic."

OPERATION: Surface Texture Enhancement

GOAL: Enhance and emphasize surface textures (metal, fabric, wood, plastic)

EXAMPLE ENHANCEMENTS:

Example 1 - Metal Texture:
"Enhance the brushed metal texture on all metallic surfaces. Increase micro-texture visibility by 40% - show directional grain lines (0.2mm width) more prominently. Add subtle anisotropic reflections that follow grain direction. Enhance the contrast between texture peaks (slightly brighter) and valleys (slightly darker) by 25%. Maintain overall color and finish. The enhancement should reveal machining marks and surface treatment detail without looking artificial. Professional product photography aesthetic."

Example 2 - Fabric Weave:
"Amplify the fabric weave texture to show individual thread crossings. Increase weave pattern visibility by 50% - make warp and weft threads distinct. Use subtle lighting to create micro-shadows in weave valleys. Enhance texture depth without changing fabric color or overall appearance. Show fabric nap direction through subtle shading. Maintain fabric's drape and form exactly. The result should look like professional macro textile photography."

Example 3 - Wood Grain Enhancement:
"Emphasize natural wood grain pattern. Increase grain line contrast by 35% - darker grain lines against lighter wood. Show subtle depth variations following growth rings. Enhance micro-texture of wood pores and surface. Maintain wood's natural color - just reveal more detail. Add subtle highlights on wood ridges from side lighting. Result should appear like high-resolution wood photography, not artificial or over-processed."

USER SPECIFICATIONS:

OPERATION: Premium Feature Highlight (Product-Focused)

GOAL: Create a high-end marketing image that highlights a key feature using only text and background modifications, ensuring the product remains the clear, unobstructed hero.

ABSOLUTE PRIMARY RULE:
**The product MUST remain 100% visible, pristine, and unobstructed.** No visual effects, glows, swirls, particles, or abstract elements should float in front of or around the product. The product is the hero of the shot.

INTELLIGENT FEATURE SELECTION (if user does not specify):
Analyze the product to identify a compelling feature to highlight.
- For Beauty: A hero ingredient (Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid).
- For Electronics: A key technology (AI Noise Cancellation, Quantum Dot Display).
- For Tools: A core benefit or material (Brushless Motor, Titanium-Coated).

CREATIVE APPROACHES (Non-Obstructive):

Approach A: Thematic Background with Clean Text
The background changes to thematically represent the feature, while the product stays pristine in the foreground. This creates a powerful visual story without touching the product itself.
- Example for "Cooling Technology": "Keep the product in the foreground, perfectly sharp and unchanged. Transform the background into a clean, minimalist surface of frosty, textured ice with subtle blue backlighting. Place the text 'VAPOR-CHAMBER COOLING' in a clean, open space in the bottom right."
- Example for "Rose Petal Ingredient": "Keep the cosmetic bottle in sharp focus. Replace the background with a soft-focus, artistic bed of pink rose petals, creating a beautiful, blurred texture behind the product. Place the text 'ROSEWATER INFUSED' in an elegant serif font in the top left corner."

Approach B: Minimalist Studio with Impactful Text
The background is a clean, professional studio setting (gradient, solid color, or textured surface). The typography is the main creative element.
- Example for "Brushless Motor": "Place the tool on a dark, textured concrete surface against a simple dark gray studio background. Use dramatic side-lighting to highlight the tool's form. Place the text 'BRUSHLESS MOTOR' in a bold, white, industrial sans-serif font in the lower third of the image. Below it, in a smaller font, add 'More Power. Longer Life.'"
- Example for "Feather-Light": "Position the product against a clean, white-to-light-gray gradient background. Use soft, even lighting to create a feeling of lightness. Place the text 'ULTRA-LIGHT FRAME' in a thin, elegant, gray font, positioned artfully in the negative space to the right of the product."

TEXT OVERLAY DESIGN & STYLE:

Font Hierarchy:
- Headline: A bold, impactful font for the feature name (e.g., "BRUSHLESS MOTOR").
- Sub-text (optional): A lighter, smaller font for a brief benefit statement (e.g., "More Power, Longer Life").
- Font choice must match the brand's personality (e.g., Serif for luxury, Sans-serif for tech).

Color & Contrast:
- Text color must have high contrast with its immediate background.
- For readability on any background, you can place the text within a subtle, semi-transparent dark or light shape.

Positioning:
- Place text in areas of negative space (e.g., top-left, bottom-right).
- **CRITICAL:** DO NOT place text directly over the product or obscure any part of it. The product and text should be two separate, balanced elements in the composition.

Your task is to generate a detailed, hyper-specific prompt for an AI image editing model, 'nano banana', to achieve a desired image manipulation. The generated prompt should be clear, concise, and provide all the necessary information for the AI to produce a high-quality result.

    **Analysis of the Request:**

    1.  **Identify the Core Objective:** What is the primary goal of the user's request? (e.g., remove the background, change the background, add an object, alter a specific detail, etc.)
    2.  **Identify the Subject:** What is the main subject of the image that needs to be preserved or modified?
    3.  **Identify the Action:** What specific action needs to be performed on the subject or the background?

    **Prompt Generation Guidelines:**

    *   **Be Specific and Descriptive:** Use vivid and precise language. Instead of "make the background nice," use "change the background to a soft-focus, professional photography studio with a neutral grey backdrop."
    *   **Focus on a Single, Clear Instruction:** While nano banana can handle multi-step instructions, for the best results, generate a prompt that focuses on a single, coherent instruction.
    *   **Preserve Key Elements:** Explicitly state what should be preserved in the image, especially the main subject. Mention details like lighting, shadows, and reflections to ensure a realistic result.
    *   **Use Negative Prompts:** If necessary, specify what should *not* be in the final image. For example, "no extra objects," "no text," "no watermarks."
    *   **Consider the Style:** If the user's request implies a certain style (e.g., "make it look more professional," "give it a vintage feel"), translate that into concrete visual descriptions. For example, for a "vintage feel," you might include "apply a warm, sepia-toned filter and add a subtle film grain effect."
    *   **Structure the Prompt Logically:** Start with the main action, then describe the subject, and finally, add details about the desired outcome.

    **Example Prompt Structure:**

    "[Action] the [Subject]. The [Subject] should be [Description of the subject's desired state]. The background should be [Description of the new background or state]. Ensure that [Details to preserve or enhance]. Avoid [Negative prompts]."

    **Your Task:**

    Based on the user's request for image editing, generate a prompt that follows these guidelines to be used with the 'nano banana' AI image editing model. The prompt should be a single block of text.

OPERATION: Generate Normal/Displacement Maps for 3D Applications

GOAL: Create technical texture maps for AR/VR/3D modeling use

EXAMPLE MAP GENERATION:

Example 1 - Normal Map Creation:
"Generate a normal map showing surface micro-detail. Analyze visible textures and convert to RGB normal map format: Red channel represents X-axis (horizontal) surface angles, Green channel represents Y-axis (vertical) angles, Blue channel represents Z-axis (height/depth). Flat surfaces appear neutral purple/blue (RGB: 128,128,255). Raised details (bolts, badges) appear lighter/pink tones. Recessed details (grooves, panel gaps) appear darker/blue tones. Capture detail at 1mm resolution. Standard tangent-space normal map suitable for 3D rendering engines."

Example 2 - Displacement Map:
"Create grayscale displacement/height map. White (RGB: 255,255,255) represents highest points (bolt heads, raised logos, top surfaces). Black (RGB: 0,0,0) represents lowest points (screw holes, deep grooves, recesses). Grey values represent intermediate heights. Smooth gradients between height transitions. Dynamic range: 8mm maximum height variation mapped across full 0-255 range. Suitable for 3D mesh displacement in AR applications. Clean, anti-aliased edges."

Example 3 - Combined PBR Texture Set:
"Generate complete PBR (Physically Based Rendering) texture set. 1) Albedo/Diffuse map: pure color without lighting (remove all shadows and highlights). 2) Normal map: surface detail (as Example 1). 3) Roughness map: white for rough areas (rubber grips), black for glossy areas (chrome parts). 4) Metallic map: white for metal, black for non-metal. All maps 4K resolution (4096x4096), aligned perfectly. Suitable for game engines and AR frameworks."

OPERATION: Professional Product Part Annotation & Callouts

GOAL: Create clear, professional, and unambiguous callouts to label specific product parts for technical documentation, user manuals, or e-commerce listings.

THE ONE-LINE, ONE-LABEL RULE (ABSOLUTE):
This is the most critical rule to prevent clutter and confusion.
1. Each labeled part gets EXACTLY ONE callout line originating from it.
2. Each callout line connects to EXACTLY ONE text label.
3. Callout lines MUST NOT cross each other or other components.
4. Do NOT use numbers, unless the user specifically requests a numbered list. The direct line-to-label connection is clearer.

CALLOUT GEOMETRY SPECIFICATIONS (for a professional look):

1. The Anchor Dot:
   - Placement: Place a small, solid circle (3-5px diameter) DIRECTLY ON the surface of the component being labeled.
   - Color: Use a high-contrast color (e.g., white dot on a dark part, dark gray dot on a light part).
   - Purpose: This is the precise origin point of the callout.

2. The Callout Line (Dog-Leg Style):
   - This line should have two segments (an "elbow") for professional organization.
   - Segment 1 (Angled): Starts from the Anchor Dot and extends outwards at a clean angle (e.g., 30, 45, or 60 degrees) away from the product's main body.
   - Segment 2 (Horizontal): At the end of the angled segment, it turns to become perfectly horizontal, extending to the text label.
   - Style: 1-2px solid line, same color as the Anchor Dot.
   - Purpose: This structure ensures all text labels can be aligned neatly in a column.

3. The Text Label:
   - Content: Clearly state the name of the part (e.g., "USB-C 3.2 Port", "Power Button", "Air Intake Vent").
   - Font: Use a clean, readable sans-serif font like Arial or Helvetica.
   - Size: 12-14pt.
   - Color: High contrast with the background.
   - Positioning: Text begins at the end of the horizontal callout line segment.

LAYOUT & COMPOSITION RULES:

- Organize Labels in Columns: All text labels should be aligned vertically in one or two columns in the negative space to the LEFT or RIGHT of the product. Do not scatter labels randomly around the image.
- Consistent Alignment: All text within a column should be left-aligned (if labels are on the right) or right-aligned (if labels are on the left). This creates a clean, organized "table of contents" look.
- Even Spacing: Maintain consistent vertical spacing between each text label in a column.
- Avoid Obstruction: Plan the angles of the callout lines so they do not cross over important product details. The path from dot to label should be clear.

INTELLIGENT PART IDENTIFICATION (if user does not specify):
Analyze the product image and identify 3-5 of the most important VISIBLE, EXTERNAL parts to label. Prioritize:
1. User Interaction Points: Buttons, switches, knobs, screens, charging ports.
2. Key Functional Components: Lenses, sensors, blades, motors, vents, connection points.
3. Branding & Model Names: The primary brand logo, model number text.
4. Material Callouts: If a specific part is made of a premium material (e.g., "Carbon Fiber Frame", "Titanium Housing").

EXAMPLE APPROACH (for a Laptop):

"Analyze: The product is a laptop. Key external parts include: USB-C ports, USB-A port, HDMI port, power button, trackpad, and keyboard.

COMPOSITION PLAN:
- Place all text labels in a neat column on the right side of the image.
- All text will be left-aligned.
- Callout lines will be dog-leg style, extending from the parts to the labels.

EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Label 'USB-C Port':
   - Place a 4px white solid dot directly on the leftmost USB-C port.
   - From this dot, draw a 2px white line at a 45-degree angle upwards and to the right.
   - After extending 2 inches, turn the line to be perfectly horizontal, extending another 3 inches to the right margin.
   - At the end of the line, add the text 'USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 Port' in Arial, 13pt, white.

2. Label 'HDMI Port':
   - Place a 4px white dot directly on the HDMI port.
   - Draw a 2px white line horizontally to the right.
   - After extending 1.5 inches, turn the line 45-degrees upwards, extending another 2 inches to align horizontally with the label text above it.
   - At the end of the line, add the text 'HDMI 2.1 Output' in Arial, 13pt, white. Ensure this label is vertically aligned below the first label with 1-inch spacing.

3. Label 'Power Button':
   - Place a 4px white dot on the power button, which is separate from the keyboard.
   - Draw a 2px white line at a 60-degree angle upwards and to the right.
   - Extend until it is horizontally aligned with the third label position in the column.
   - At the end of the line, add the text 'Power Button / Fingerprint Reader' in Arial, 13pt, white.

...Continue for all identified parts, ensuring all labels are neatly aligned in the right-hand column and all connection lines are clean and do not cross. The laptop itself must remain completely unchanged beneath these vector overlays. The final image should look like a professional page from a high-end user manual."

USER SPECIFICATIONS:
{user_details}

IF NO USER DETAILS PROVIDED:
- Intelligently identify 3-5 key external parts using the priority list above.
- Use the direct dot-to-line-to-label system.
- Organize all labels into a single, clean column on either the left or right side.

PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS CHECKLIST:
- ✓ Is the ONE-LINE, ONE-LABEL rule followed for every callout?
- ✓ Are all callout lines clean, non-crossing, and easy to follow?
- ✓ Are all text labels neatly aligned in a column?
- ✓ Is the font clean, readable, and professional?
- ✓ Is there high contrast between the callout graphics and the image?
- ✓ Is the product completely untouched beneath the overlays?
- ✓ Is the final image clear, professional, and unambiguous?

NEVER DO:
- Draw more than one line from a single part or to a single label.
- Allow callout lines to cross each other.
- Scatter labels randomly around the image.
- Use numbering unless specifically requested by the user.
- Place labels where they are hard to read or ambiguous.
- Obscure any part of the product with text or lines.
